### Working-

Travello is built on the top of technologies such as JQuery and AJAX call of REST API services. Travello asks for the travelling venue of the user's choice and hence asynchronously fetches the related WikiPedia articles (along with principle thumbnail and other metadata) and also some New York Times news articles based on the location provided. Then Travello does some JS and JQuery manipulations of the JSON data object recieved asynchronously from the AJAX call of REST APIs provided by MediaWiki and New York Times, and hence appends the insightful articles and other info to its web app body for the users to see. 

Therefore assisting the travel enthusiasts and voyagers to know more about their venue of choice and prepare accordingly. :)
